# 🔒 Login Security Fix Complete

## 🎯 **Security Issue Addressed**

**User Feedback**: "We need to remove the demo credentials from showing up, we can keep those to log in but we cannot show them so please remove them from there"

### **Problem Analysis**
- **Demo credentials displayed publicly** on the login page
- **Security vulnerability** exposing `admin` / `recovery2025` credentials to all visitors
- **Professional appearance issue** - production sites shouldn't show test credentials

---

## ✅ **SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED**

### **File Modified**: `src/pages/Auth/LoginPage.tsx`

**Removed Public Display:**
```jsx
// ❌ REMOVED - Security Risk
<DemoCredentials>
  <strong>Demo Credentials:</strong><br/>
  Username: admin<br/>
  Password: recovery2025
</DemoCredentials>
```

**Kept Functional Authentication:**
```jsx
// ✅ KEPT - Login Logic Intact
if (credentials.username === 'admin' && credentials.password === 'recovery2025') {
  localStorage.setItem('recovery-office-auth', 'authenticated');
  localStorage.setItem('recovery-office-user', JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Alex Bianchi',
    role: 'Senior Recovery Specialist',
    email: 'alex.bianchi@recovery-office.com'
  }));
  navigate('/dashboard');
}
```
