        question: "How much of my lost investment can I expect to recover?",
        answer: "Recovery amounts vary widely depending on the specific circumstances of your case, including how long ago the fraud occurred, what assets remain accessible, and whether multiple victims are involved. Recovery rates typically range from 30-70% of losses, though some cases may result in full recovery or lower percentages. We'll provide a realistic assessment during our initial consultation."

        question: "What documentation do I need to begin the recovery process?",
        answer: "You should gather all documentation related to your investment, including account statements, contracts, prospectuses, emails, text messages, recorded phone calls, marketing materials, wire transfer receipts, and any communications with the investment provider. Don't worry if you don't have everything â€“ we can help determine what's most important for your specific case."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I pursue recovery if the investment was made years ago?",
        answer: "Yes, though time limitations do apply. Most jurisdictions have statutes of limitations for fraud claims ranging from 2-6 years, though these can sometimes be extended if the fraud was concealed. Even with older cases, recovery options may exist through regulatory actions or bankruptcy proceedings. We'll evaluate your case regardless of when the investment occurred."
