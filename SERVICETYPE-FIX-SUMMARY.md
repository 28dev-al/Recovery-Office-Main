# ServiceType Enum Conflict Resolution - Recovery Office

## Problem Summary
The Recovery Office TypeScript codebase had conflicting `ServiceType` definitions causing 10+ compilation errors:
- `src/types/api.types.ts` contained one ServiceType enum
- `src/types/booking.types.ts` contained a different ServiceType type
- Components were importing from different sources, causing type incompatibility

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Single Source of Truth
Created `src/types/service.types.ts` as the canonical ServiceType definition:
- Unified enum with all service types needed by the application
- Added helper functions for validation and display names
- Included both Recovery Office specific types and legacy consultation types

### 2. Updated All Imports
- Removed local ServiceType definitions from `api.types.ts` and `booking.types.ts`
- Updated all imports to use `ServiceType` from `service.types.ts`
- Added re-export in `api.types.ts` for backward compatibility

### 3. Fixed Component Usage
- Updated `BookingContext.tsx` to use unified ServiceType
- Fixed fallback services to use correct enum values
- Updated `ServiceSelection.tsx` mock data
- Fixed test files to import from correct location

### 4. Files Modified
1. `src/types/service.types.ts` - Created new file
2. `src/types/booking.types.ts` - Removed local ServiceType, added import
3. `src/types/api.types.ts` - Removed enum, added import and re-export
4. `src/context/BookingContext.tsx` - Updated to use UnifiedServiceType
5. `src/components/booking/ServiceSelection.tsx` - Updated import
6. `src/context/tests/BookingContext.test.tsx` - Updated import
7. `src/hooks/useBookingStepValidation.ts` - Updated import

## Results
✅ TypeScript compilation: **0 errors**
✅ Build process: **Successful**
✅ All ServiceType references now use single source of truth
✅ Backward compatibility maintained through re-exports

## ServiceType Enum Values
The unified ServiceType enum now includes:
- Financial Recovery Services: `CRYPTOCURRENCY_RECOVERY`, `INVESTMENT_FRAUD_RECOVERY`, etc.
- Legacy Consultation Types: `INITIAL_CONSULTATION`, `FOLLOW_UP`, etc.
- Generic Types: `RECOVERY`, `CONSULTATION`, `INVESTIGATION`, `LEGAL`

This ensures all components have access to the service types they need while maintaining type safety throughout the application.
