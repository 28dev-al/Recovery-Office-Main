## Implementation Details

All components were built with:
- **Sacred Geometry Principles**: Using PHI, PHI_INVERSE, and Fibonacci sequences for proportions

## Usage

All components can be imported directly from the main design system entry point:

  ResourceCard,
  PremiumButton,
  IconButton 
} from 'src/design-system/components';
```

These components form the foundation for building consistent, professional user interfaces for financial services, ensuring a premium look and feel while maintaining sacred geometry principles throughout the application.
