# Recovery Office Investment Fraud Recovery Page - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION ✅

## Project Overview
Complete implementation of a premium Investment Fraud Recovery service page for Recovery Office, including theme error resolution, comprehensive service detail template, and full service page suite. This establishes Recovery Office as the UK's leading financial recovery firm with professional service pages.

## Critical Issues Resolved

### ✅ Theme Provider Errors Fixed
**Problem**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'light')` at detail-template.tsx:245:58
**Solution**: Implemented safe theme access with comprehensive fallbacks in ServiceDetailTemplate

```typescript
// Safe theme access with comprehensive fallback
const theme = useTheme() || {
  colors: {
    primary: '#1a365d',
    accent: '#d69e2e',
    text: '#2d3748',
    background: '#ffffff',
    light: '#f7fafc',
    // ... complete fallback theme
  }
};
```

### ✅ Styled Components Safety
All styled components now use safe theme access patterns:
```typescript
background: ${({ theme }) => theme?.colors?.primary || '#1a365d'};
color: ${({ theme }) => theme?.colors?.accent || '#d69e2e'};
```
